# 2D_VSE_probe
`python_scripts`: Python scripts used for the 2D-VSE paper  
`sample_inputs`: representative set of Q-Chem input/output files (see README under that folder for details)  
`workflow_example`: example (CXF-D in DMSO) illustrating the entire procedure of calculating solvent electric fields (starting from the MD trajectory)  
The zip file (`structures_solute_solvent_clusters.zip`) contains all the geometries of truncated solute-solvent clusters generated from fixed-charge or AMOEBA MD trajectories that were used in this work.
